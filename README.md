# Memory Game Project

## What is the Memory Game
Matching games are games that require players to match similar items. As the name implies, participants need to find a match for a word, picture, or card.

## Challenge
Match the cards with the highest number of stars, and this is done with less movements as the player is required to get three stars finish the game in less than 12 moves only.

## How I built the Memory Game
I manipulated the DOM with JS, recreated part of the HTML and also styled the game.
-  created a deck list of cards that shuffles when page is refreshed or restart.
- created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play.
- Rating according to number of the player moves
- added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
- create a pop-up modal when player wins game

## Technical
